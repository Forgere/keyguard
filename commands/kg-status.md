# KeyGuard Status

Use the `list_services` tool from the `keyguard-server` to show all services currently managed. Then, explain to the user that KeyGuard is active and protecting their keys by mapping them based on minimum permissions.

Ask the user if they want to register a new key or if they need a specific key for a task.
